An incomplete, unsorted, and overly concise bag of stuff that describes
what is in option-9, and what I'd like to be there.

Plot
- This should stay small and ridiculous.
- "Supreme Commander Snarkill of the Snarlian Empire owes you
  9 bucks and has refused to pay. The only response to this affront is
  total annihilation of the Snarlian Empire. It commences immediately."

Levels [to be implemented]
- Line drawn, or stippled, to preserve the visual style.
- Going from entering an Empire's military borders to the Citadel itself.
- 9 levels with 9 bosses
  - Straw man partitions of the levels...
  - Level 1: Front Lines
  - Level 2: Supply Lines
  - Level 3: Asteroid Field
  - Level 4: Main Encampment
  - Level 5: Warp Gate
  - Level 6: Snarlian Homeworld
  - Level 7: Royal City
  - Level 8: Elite Guard
  - Level 9: Citadel 

Sound [to be implemented]
- Music
- Effects

Shields
- Current shields
  - Shot shield (protect only against shots hitting you)
  - Ship shield (protect against shots and ships hitting you)
- To be implemented
  - Reflect or bend shots away from ship.
  - Multiplayer shield which is stronger the longer players stay together.
  - Pick up shrapnel and use it as a physical shield rotating around player.

Weapons
  - Shots (discrete objects flung from a muzzle)
    - Current Shots
      - Varieties
        - Simple Shot (slow, low damage)
        - Hard Shot (faster, kills bullets and keeps going, stopped by
          ships)
        - Super Shot (Fastest, kill bullets and other ships, keeps going)
      - Can be charged OR rapid fire[tbi], but not at the same time.
    - To be implemented
      - Missles that can upgrade to target enemies.

  - Mines
    - Current Mines
      - Proximity
      - Field
    - To be implemented
      - Fence mine (need X layed mines that then connect to provide a fence)

  - Passive
    - Current Passive Weapons
      - Tesla Gun
    - To be implemented
      - Slow time/movement/thinking/etc for other ships/etc in a radius.

  - Beam Weapons (to be implemented)

Powerups & related
- A shot can be charged and charged faster
- Get more health
- Get any described weapon and/or increase current one's power.
- Get any described shield and/or increase current one's power.

UI
- Stack-like event handler [Mick]
- Quake-like console [Mick]
- Splash screen
- map controls to actions screen
- tutorial mode?
- demo mode?
- high score screen?
- load/save game at either level boundaries or checkpoints in levels.
- possible inventory screen: select stored powerups (analogous to potions?)

Technical stuff
- Level layout & editing
- Collision detection with level elements
- Recast of matrix lib interface to be more conventional [in progress].
- Inspection of the powerup code and DSL to see if it can be made better.
- Clean up definitions of generic functions, so they are all initialized.
